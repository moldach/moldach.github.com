      <description>A graduate student in our laboratory recently asked me if it was possible to include more than two images, side-by-side, in Xaringan.
Of course anything is possible, however, most blog posts only touch on the most basic things you can do. With custom CSS you can do whatever you want. I wanted to create an image-grid of a bunch of GIFs so I used the ninjutsu theme to accomplish it.</description>

      <description>Recently I got interested in using the xaringan package for creating HTML based R Markdown documents because I could use the widgetframe package to embed htmlwidgets as responsive iframes (I had created some spinning 3D visulizations with pseudo-coloring I wanted to present interactively).
xaringan, it&amp;rsquo;s a R pacakges for creating slideshows with remark.js through R Markdown.
Around the same time I learnt about Drake (or &amp;ldquo;Data Frames in R for Make&amp;rdquo;) which is an amazing a time-saving reproducible build system for data scientist specifically tailored to R.</description>
