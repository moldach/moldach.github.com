      <description>A graduate student in our laboratory recently asked me if it was possible to include more than two images, side-by-side, in Xaringan.
Of course anything is possible, however, most blog posts only touch on the most basic things you can do. With custom CSS you can do whatever you want. I wanted to create an image-grid of a bunch of GIFs so I used the ninjutsu theme to accomplish it.</description>
