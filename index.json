Shiny Application\rYou can read as much theory as you want but the best way to learn something is to pull-up your sleeves and get your hands dirty by implementing a project.\nI’ve been wanting to develop a Shiny application for sometime but the opportunity has never arisen. In my current role as a R developer, I provide client-side implementations via Java with the help of the RServe 📦 - so Shiny isn’t needed. Well, if the opportunity doesn’t present itself on the job it’s time for a side-project!\nI wasn’t exactly sure what kind of project I should do until I saw a blog post by Timo Grossenbacher on bivariate maps with ggplot2 and sf.\nThe map shows income (in-)equality in Switzerland at the municipality level by visualizing two variables at the same time. What instantly attracted me was the beautiful relief of the mountainous Swiss landscape. It’s not something I’ve seen much from ggplot2 maps - something usually reserved for GIS programs. I thought creating an application for geography would be a fun and engaging use of a Shiny application. My current role as a developer for a web-application that enables complex meta-analysis and visualization caters to biologists rather than specilazied bioinformaticians- NetworkAnalyst.ca. I thought it might be cool to do a similar thing for people who aren’t GIS specialist (or even familiar with R) and enable them to quickly create maps and save them (either as PNGs or PDFs)?\nOne of the intial challenges was finding a good dataset. I had wanted to do a project on my home province of Alberta but eventually settled on Hawaii instead for a couple reasons. One is that I could find relief’s for the State of Hawaii in two levels of detail: 100m and 200m. The second was the State of Hawaii also provides a large number of shapefiles which I could lay overtop of the relief. The amount of open data available to Hawaii attractive, and the fact that they are islands presented certain opportunities… and challenges, as well.\nI wanted to provide users with a range maps. I wanted maps at different scales and with different contexts such as focusing on the marine environment or the terrestrial enviornment. I wanted maps covering the whole state of Hawaii, others showing individual islands (or groups of islands), and others giving the user a view of the city level. It was here that I got inspiration from Erin Davis’s beautiful street maps in “The Beatiful Hidden Logic of Cities - Worldwide”.\nErin’s legend looked great! Unfortunately she didn’t have a programatic way to generate these labels, she did them in Adobe Photoshop (personal correspondence). I tried to write some code to generate labels programattically using key_glyph = \u0026#34;point\u0026#34; to set sf object glyphs as points and then use the override.aes trick to get circles (like in this SO post post) but I didn’t like the look. To be honest lables are something that could still use work in the ggplot2 world IMO 🤷\nJake Kaupp did a #TidyTuesday submission for Week #40: Pizza Party! showing all of the pizza spots in the five-boroughs and came up with a nice way of constructing a color legend with ggplotGrob() as well as a neat use of colorspace::darken():\nFor Shiny UI inspiration I looked towards some of the winners of the 1st ever Shiny Contest (something I hope RStudio brings back next year!). I can’t express how much I learn from reading other peoples code and for this particular application I was heavily inspired by the David Smale’s, winner of “Best Design”, 69 Love Songs: A Lyrical Analysis. What was really cool was it was hosted on the RStudio cloud so I could go in and change things and see how it affected which for me was one of the coolest ways to grok Shiny.\nBuilding the application\rGetting back to elevation reliefs for a second. Before I learned that you could easily get Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data from mapzen via the {`geoviz’} 📦, I used QGIS to subset the reliefs. Here’s a screencast of the process:\nFor the shapefiles, sometimes it was simple to subset the geom_sf() object via a column with island information (Hawaii, Maui, Oahu, Kauai) using dplyr::filter(). However, when there was no information I also used QGIS to subset the shapefiles.\nNote: I’m positive there is a way to do this via a bounding-box in R I just never learned how… please send me a message and I’ll update this if you know a way! Here’s a video of how I did it with QGIS:\nThis project was a great learning experience not only for learning Shiny \u0026amp; Spatial Mapping, but also learning a bit more about the development cycle of a “production” applcation is like. It’s kind of like the ol’ aphorism “Perfect is the eney of good” - you want to get your appltion out to the public ASAP. I released the app as soon as I had tested for bugs and thought the UI was good-enough.\nAfter its release, I wanted to add a new feature - Rayshader!, Rayshader is one of the hot-new tools in The Landscape of Spatial Data …","date":1574467200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1574467200,"objectID":"683ee05cc28dd75c868b7a8f49e87355","permalink":"https://example.com/project/hinuhinu/","publishdate":"2019-11-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/hinuhinu/","section":"project","summary":"CLICK HERE TO GO TO THE SHINY APPLICATION!!!\nInspiration for the Shiny Application\rYou can read as much theory as you want but the best way to learn something is to pull-up your sleeves and get your hands dirty by implementing a project.","tags":[],"title":"Shiny Dev and Software Release Cycles and Rayshader, Oh My!","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1574467200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1574467200,"objectID":"9f15ecce3aedd4863b2382e6d4c0d8ba","permalink":"https://example.com/project/shiny-filters/","publishdate":"2019-11-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/shiny-filters/","section":"project","summary":" ","tags":null,"title":"Shiny-filteRs: Mobile app bridging languages, blending art, geolocation, and privacy","type":"project"},{"authors":["Matthew J.

I always loved how their aesthethics captured the energy and artistry of board-riding in its purest form.\nIf you have no idea what I’m talking about here’s some samples from print advertisments and a clip from 2003’s Big Youth Happening which I would say was the ultimate inspiration for this post.\nNon-photorealistic rendering (NPR) is a combination of computer graphics and computer vision that produces renderings in various artistic, expressive or stylized ways. A new art form that couldn’t have existed without computers. Researchers have proposed many algorithms and styles such as painting, pen-and-ink drawing, tile mosaics, stippling, streamline visualization, and tensor field visualization. Although the details vary, the goal is to make an image look like some other image. Two main approaches to designing these algorithms exist. Greedy algorithms greedily place strokes to match the target goas. Optimization algorithms iteratively place and then adjust stroke positions to minimize the objective function. NPR can be done using a number of machine learning methods, most commonly General Adverserial Networks or Convolution Neural Networks(CNN) such as painting and drawing.\nI wanted to use lengstrom/fast-style-transfer, an optimization technique, on a video of my friends and I backcountry skiing and snowboarding in The Rocky Mountains of Alberta.\nFast-style-transfer is a TensorFlow CNN model based on a combination of Gatys’ A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style, Johnson’s Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution, and Ulyanov’s Instance Normalization. I’ll skip the details here because it’s been been far better described in the publications above (or in layman’s terms here, here, and here), suffice it to say it allows you to compose images/videos in the style of another image. Besides being fun it’s a nice visual way of showing the capabilities and internal representations of neural networks.\nfast-style-transfer repo comes with 6 trained models on famous paintings, allowing you to quikcly style your images (or videos) like them. But what’s the fun in doing what others have alread done?\nI wanted to see what kind of effect would be produced by training style transfer networks around interesting shapes and patterns! I selected a number patterns I thought would be interesting, for example animal patterns, fractals, fibonnaci sequences, a few vaporwave images (of course), and a bunch of images taken under a SEM microscope.\nI then constructed a script to train 50 models simultaneously on a HPC (using a GPU NVIDIA V100 Volta; a top-of-the-line $10,000 GPU - spared no expense). After many many hours of training, across hundreds of cores, I selected the 20 best (i.e. most aesthetically pleasing) models to apply to the video.\n(The entire high-quality video can be found here](https://youtu.be/TuN4456PK-c).\nTechnical Notes: When training the models I noticed that the checkpoint files were being corrupted. I found a closed issue on the repo: #78 stating that Tensorflow’s Saver class was updated so you’ll need to change line 136 in /src/optimize.py.\nThe script for training all of the networks on an HPC with a SLURM job scheduler is below, and can be run with bash fastTrainer.bash \u0026lt;image_path\u0026gt; \u0026lt;out_path\u0026gt; \u0026lt;test_path\u0026gt;. Simply clone lengstrom/fast-style-transfer and create three folders inside. Create a sub-directory where you’ll put all the style images you want to train, another sub-directory for the output (.ckpt files used to style your .mp4 videos), and a test sub-directory for the model. As a default I used the chicago for training and I’m not entirely sure if that makes a difference.\n!/bin/bash #$ -pwd # bash fastTrainer.bash /images/ /outpath/ /testpath/ ## ## An embarrassingly parallel script to train many style transfer networks on a HPC ## Access to SLURM job scheduler and fast-style-transfer is required to run this program. ## The three mandatory pathways must be specified in the indicated order.

We have cronR setup on RStudio server at work, and it has a nice RStudio addin which allows us to schedule tasks around any complex schedule. You can use these kind of tools to automate data collections, automate markdown reports to e-mail, or even the weather.\nAlternatively, when you want a function (or script) to launch every time you start R you can place these inside .Rprofile.\nBut what about if you want a function to start only the first time a user logs in? This could be something simple (like a reminder) to fill in a progress report, or in this case a bit of Monday Morning (de)Motivation. This is a job for logfiles!\nLet’s be straight here, I love Mondays (because rweekly is released!), but most people don’t! Therefore, I made a .csv file of 178 quotes about Monday and a folder of 83 .png images of cartoon characters sleeping. I used the .First() function in .Rprofile to create a logfile (if one doesn’t already exist) and randomly pair an image with a quote the first time a user logs in on Monday morning (using the advicegiveR package). Here’s some examples of images a user might see first thing Monday morning:\nThe Good The Bad The Ugly Any other time of that day (or any other day of the week) it will simply call a sage piece of collected advice from the R-help forum via the fortunes package. An example:\nR will always be arcane to those who do not make a serious effort to learn it. It is not meant to be intuitive and easy for casual users to just plunge into. It is far too complex and powerful for that.
