In my current role as a R developer, I provide client-side implementations via Java with the help of the RServe üì¶ - so Shiny isn‚Äôt needed. Well, if the opportunity doesn‚Äôt present itself on the job it‚Äôs time for a side-project!\nI wasn‚Äôt exactly sure what kind of project I should do until I saw a blog post by Timo Grossenbacher on bivariate maps with ggplot2 and sf.\nThe map shows income (in-)equality in Switzerland at the municipality level by visualizing two variables at the same time. What instantly attracted me was the beautiful relief of the mountainous Swiss landscape. It‚Äôs not something I‚Äôve seen much from ggplot2 maps - something usually reserved for GIS programs. I thought creating an application for geography would be a fun and engaging use of a Shiny application. My current role as a developer for a web-application that enables complex meta-analysis and visualization caters to biologists rather than specilazied bioinformaticians- NetworkAnalyst.ca. I thought it might be cool to do a similar thing for people who aren‚Äôt GIS specialist (or even familiar with R) and enable them to quickly create maps and save them (either as PNGs or PDFs)?\nOne of the intial challenges was finding a good dataset. I had wanted to do a project on my home province of Alberta but eventually settled on Hawaii instead for a couple reasons. One is that I could find relief‚Äôs for the State of Hawaii in two levels of detail: 100m and 200m. The second was the State of Hawaii also provides a large number of shapefiles which I could lay overtop of the relief. The amount of open data available to Hawaii attractive, and the fact that they are islands presented certain opportunities‚Ä¶ and challenges, as well.\nI wanted to provide users with a range maps. I wanted maps at different scales and with different contexts such as focusing on the marine environment or the terrestrial enviornment. I wanted maps covering the whole state of Hawaii, others showing individual islands (or groups of islands), and others giving the user a view of the city level. It was here that I got inspiration from Erin Davis‚Äôs beautiful street maps in ‚ÄúThe Beatiful Hidden Logic of Cities - Worldwide‚Äù.\nErin‚Äôs legend looked great! Unfortunately she didn‚Äôt have a programatic way to generate these labels, she did them in Adobe Photoshop (personal correspondence). I tried to write some code to generate labels programattically using key_glyph = \"point\" to set sf object glyphs as points and then use the override.aes trick to get circles (like in this SO post post) but I didn‚Äôt like the look. To be honest lables are something that could still use work in the ggplot2 world IMO ü§∑\nJake Kaupp did a #TidyTuesday submission for Week #40: Pizza Party! showing all of the pizza spots in the five-boroughs and came up with a nice way of constructing a color legend with ggplotGrob() as well as a neat use of colorspace::darken():\nFor Shiny UI inspiration I looked towards some of the winners of the 1st ever Shiny Contest (something I hope RStudio brings back next year!). I can‚Äôt express how much I learn from reading other peoples code and for this particular application I was heavily inspired by the David Smale‚Äôs, winner of ‚ÄúBest Design‚Äù, 69 Love Songs: A Lyrical Analysis. What was really cool was it was hosted on the RStudio cloud so I could go in and change things and see how it affected which for me was one of the coolest ways to grok Shiny.\n\rBuilding the application\rGetting back to elevation reliefs for a second. Before I learned that you could easily get Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data from mapzen via the {`geoviz‚Äô} üì¶, I used QGIS to subset the reliefs. Here‚Äôs a screencast of the process:\n\rFor the shapefiles, sometimes it was simple to subset the geom_sf() object via a column with island information (Hawaii, Maui, Oahu, Kauai) using dplyr::filter(). However, when there was no information I also used QGIS to subset the shapefiles.\n\rNote: I‚Äôm positive there is a way to do this via a bounding-box in R I just never learned how‚Ä¶ please send me a message and I‚Äôll update this if you know a way! Here‚Äôs a video of how I did it with QGIS:\n\r\rThis project was a great learning experience not only for learning Shiny \u0026amp; Spatial Mapping, but also learning a bit more about the development cycle of a ‚Äúproduction‚Äù applcation is like. It‚Äôs kind of like the ol‚Äô aphorism ‚ÄúPerfect is the eney of good‚Äù - you want to get your appltion out to the public ASAP. I released the app as soon as I had tested for bugs and thought the UI was good-enough.\nAfter its release, I wanted to add a new feature - Rayshader!, Rayshader is one of the hot-new tools in The Landscape of Spatial Data Analysis in R. Historically geographic information had always been presented in the form of two-dimensional maps, all the way from cave walls, parchment to computer screens. Because spatial information is inherently 3D, it makes sense that the tools available today are allowing 3D depictions of geographical data to escape the realm of mere novelty. With Rayshader you can control things like the lighting, camera tilt, and angle of view which provides an engaging experience for the audience.\nI was signed up for Tyler Morgan-Wall‚Äôs (the developer of Rayshader) Penn State MUSA Masterclass: 3D Mapping and Visualization with R and Rayshader the next month (the awesome talk is here and the Git repo is here) and wanted to spend a bit of time to demo the package before taking the class.\n\rI came up with some very plain ‚Äúdesert‚Äù-y looking maps of Hawaii:\n\rAlthough I had wanted to allow the user to interact with the 3D maps, I ran into issues where the application attempted to use more memory then was avialable under the free-tier plan of Shinyapps.io. The RStudio documentation on debugging your application‚Äôs section on Memory wa useful for figuring this out as it suggests looking in the application‚Äôs logs for 2019-11-18T15:12:16.088451+00:00 shinyapps[system]: Out of memory!. I settled on providing the ‚Äúfly-by‚Äù videos innstead.\nAfter attending Tyler‚Äôs class I wanted to update my application again by including a satellite overlay; I spent some time figuring out the best way to do this, modifying the easing function and rayshader::render_movie() parameters to make longer videos, testing it out, and then using rsconnect::deployApp() to re-deploy my application.\nI decided to merge all four videos together using VSCD Video Editor and overlaid some a musical track. Although Tyler promised Rayshader would have VR/AR capabilities in the near-future, I simply couldn‚Äôt wait so I also made another version of the video with a steroscopic 3D effect for viewing with red and cyan anaglyph 3D glasses:\n\rFuture Directions/Things Learned/General Musings\rI‚Äôm not planning on developing this specific application any further as I‚Äôm quite happy with the final outcome. This project was mainly to learn:\n\rShiny\rSpatial Mapping\rSoftware release life cycles\r\rFrom talking with my father he told me that software he worked on with IBM would be released with ~2000 known bugs.\n\r‚ÄúBetter a diamond with a flaw than a pebble without‚Äù - Confucius\n\rIt‚Äôs important to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs for your project:\nNote: Those scrupulous enough to peer into my repo will have found that I do not always follow my own advice‚Ä¶\nNow theoretically let‚Äôs say I was building this application for a client and they just had to have! interactive 3D visualizations produced with Rayshader (something I‚Äôm not sure if Shiny is ideal for anyways) you could pay for a higher tier in Shinyapps.io to get a performance boost (i.e. more RAM üêè).\nAnother thing that I may have wanted to do if my application was more complex is to provide the user with a tour using the {cicerone} üì¶ like what one sees on the excellent tour of the iSEE Shiny interface.\nAfter 75 commits I‚Äôm pretty tired, so I didn‚Äôt include any code snippets here (BTW you can find all the code on Github). Full-disclosure: the 75 commtis (and code) are currently split between two-repositories and I feel a bit of shame for that‚Ä¶\nBut there is a reason for this. I had intially started off the [mahalo] repository because I wanted to create package like the {bcmaps} üì¶ but for Hawaii (I may still if there is enough interest from the community, but at the moment this is on-hold).\nAlong with this, I also wanted to create a Showcase/Companion for the package with Shiny that would give users a run-through.\nI wasn‚Äôt sure what the ‚Äúbest practices‚Äù for this are: do you keep the app with the package or do you have a seperate repo? I reached out to John Coene ([@jdatap](https://twitter.com/jdatap)), because he‚Äôs an all-around nice guy (and also Swiss), and he suggested keeping them seperate if the application is large (adivce I followed) and to also use {golem} (advice which I did not follow - I still think it‚Äôs a great idea and I‚Äôll consider for my next app though!).\nI still need to spend some time figuring out how to supply datasets as I ran into issues with my project. I knew that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to just drop all of the shapefiles into my git repo because Github is meant for code and not data. I also knew that you could acclerate ggplot2 by using a canvas to speed up rendering plots so I thought to myself ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm just developing a map package I can generate‚Äùbasemaps\" as .Rds objects and then use those in my hinuhin repository to overlay other shapefiles on-top of\". Even though I avoided including most of the GIS information by producing these basemaps I had to set up a free account with Git Large File Storage to include the shapefiles I overlaid in this project and that took up 80% of my quota.\nOne way I had heard of dealing with this was either by hosting on a server: either, an internal server (means the Shiny application can only be used within an organization and not the general public) or hosting the data on the cloud (e.g. Amazon S3). Still other packages have dealt with this issue by accessing web-hosted databases via HTTP requests to APIs - which is well and good if the data is already available from an online database (it was not)\nThe bcmaps package handels data in a way proposed by G. Brooke Anderson \u0026amp; Dirk Eddelbuettel ([@eddelbuettel](https://twitter.com/eddelbuettel)), via a drat repository which allows a recommended maximum size of 1GB - I may have to look into this option if the Twitterverse is interested in a package for maps of Hawaii.\n\rBrief thought on the future of Rayshader\rThere are a number of companies today trying to map out city streets to create high-quality 3D maps for self-driving cars and projection projects (see: The Race to Map the World in 3D):\nImage: Carmera\n\rGetting access to this kind of data would be awesome because it would mean you could overlay high-quality images over LIDAR like this one produced by Tyler of Philadelphia:\n\rIf you missed it at the top you can CLICK HERE TO GO TO MY SHINY APPLICATION DEPLOYMENT!!!\n\r\r\r","date":1574467200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1574467200,"objectID":"97b3031e33a83387662da6e9dcd73930","permalink":"/project/taster/","publishdate":"2019-11-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/taster/","section":"project","summary":"CLICK HERE TO GO TO THE SHINY APPLICATION!!!\nInspiration for the Shiny Application\r\rYou can read as much theory as you want but the best way to learn something is to pull-up your sleeves and get your hands dirty by implementing a project.\n\rI‚Äôve been wanting to develop a Shiny application for sometime but the opportunity has never arisen.

A new art form that couldn\u0026rsquo;t have existed without computers. Researchers have proposed many algorithms and styles such as painting, pen-and-ink drawing, tile mosaics, stippling, streamline visualization, and tensor field visualization. Although the details vary, the goal is to make an image look like some other image. Two main approaches to designing these algorithms exist. Greedy algorithms greedily place strokes to match the target goas. Optimization algorithms iteratively place and then adjust stroke positions to minimize the objective function. NPR can be done using a number of machine learning methods, most commonly General Adverserial Networks or Convolution Neural Networks(CNN) such as painting and drawing.\nI wanted to use lengstrom/fast-style-transfer, an optimization technique, on a video of my friends and I backcountry skiing and snowboarding in The Rocky Mountains of Alberta.\nFast-style-transfer is a TensorFlow CNN model based on a combination of Gatys\u0026rsquo; A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style, Johnson\u0026rsquo;s Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution, and Ulyanov\u0026rsquo;s Instance Normalization. I\u0026rsquo;ll skip the details here because it\u0026rsquo;s been been far better described in the publications above (or in layman\u0026rsquo;s terms here, here, and here), suffice it to say it allows you to compose images/videos in the style of another image. Besides being fun it\u0026rsquo;s a nice visual way of showing the capabilities and internal representations of neural networks.\nfast-style-transfer repo comes with 6 trained models on famous paintings, allowing you to quikcly style your images (or videos) like them. But what\u0026rsquo;s the fun in doing what others have alread done?\nI wanted to see what kind of effect would be produced by training style transfer networks around interesting shapes and patterns! I selected a number patterns I thought would be interesting, for example animal patterns, fractals, fibonnaci sequences, a few vaporwave images (of course), and a bunch of images taken under a SEM microscope.\nI then constructed a script to train 50 models simultaneously on a HPC (using a GPU NVIDIA V100 Volta; a top-of-the-line $10,000 GPU - spared no expense). After many many hours of training, across hundreds of cores, I selected the 20 best (i.e. most aesthetically pleasing) models to apply to the video.\n(The entire high-quality video can be found here](https://youtu.be/TuN4456PK-c).\nTechnical Notes: When training the models I noticed that the checkpoint files were being corrupted. I found a closed issue on the repo: #78 stating that Tensorflow\u0026rsquo;s Saver class was updated so you\u0026rsquo;ll need to change line 136 in /src/optimize.py.\nThe script for training all of the networks on an HPC with a SLURM job scheduler is below, and can be run with bash fastTrainer.bash \u0026lt;image_path\u0026gt; \u0026lt;out_path\u0026gt; \u0026lt;test_path\u0026gt;. Simply clone lengstrom/fast-style-transfer and create three folders inside. Create a sub-directory where you\u0026rsquo;ll put all the style images you want to train, another sub-directory for the output (.ckpt files used to style your .mp4 videos), and a test sub-directory for the model. As a default I used the chicago for training and I\u0026rsquo;m not entirely sure if that makes a difference.\n!/bin/bash #$ -pwd # bash fastTrainer.bash /images/ /outpath/ /testpath/ ## ## An embarrassingly parallel script to train many style transfer networks on a HPC ## Access to SLURM job scheduler and fast-style-transfer is required to run this program. ## The three mandatory pathways must be specified in the indicated order.

That being said an AI generated work of art recently sold for $432,500 at Christie\u0026rsquo;s (the first auction house to offer a piece of art created by an algorithm).\nBesides the opportunity to exercise my right-brain, it was a good chance to gain some experience with tensorflow and python. This project was also illuminating because it made the hidden layers of networks more comprehensible by literally allowing me to see how neural networks are performing!\nI think the field of Feature visualization is exciting because it allows to peer behind the curtain and see how networks learn to classify images accurately. Take for example the Activation atlas which reveals visual abstractions within a model. It gives a global view of a dataset by showing feature visualization of averaged activation values from a neural network.\n As an analogy, while the 26 letters in the alphabet provide a basis for English, seeing how letters are commonly combined to make words gives far more insight into the concepts that can be expressed than the letters alone. Similarly, activation atlases give us a bigger picture view by showing common combinations of neurons.\n In a perfect world the artist/user should have control over the decisions made by the algorithm. For example, to specify spatially varying styles to use, so that different rendering styles are used in different parts of the image, or to specify positions of individuial strokes. However, training these models is still too slow to be useful in an interactive application.\n","date":1555804800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555804800,"objectID":"4c9587f5d30f42fac519d583f09a80f1","permalink":"/post/faststyletransfer/","publishdate":"2019-04-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/faststyletransfer/","section":"post","summary":"Volcom was founded in 1991, it was the first company to combine skateboarding, surfing and snowboarding under one brand from it\u0026rsquo;s incepetion.

We have cronR setup on RStudio server at work, and it has a nice RStudio addin which allows us to schedule tasks around any complex schedule. You can use these kind of tools to automate data collections, automate markdown reports to e-mail, or even the weather.\nAlternatively, when you want a function (or script) to launch every time you start R you can place these inside .Rprofile.\nBut what about if you want a function to start only the first time a user logs in?
